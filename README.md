# Android Chat Room Application

This Android Chat Room Application is in its early stage of development and will be updated rapidly. It aims to provide a mobile interface for real-time communication in chat rooms, leveraging WebSocket technology for instant messaging.

## Introduction

This application allows users to view a list of contacts with their names and numbers displayed in a RecyclerView. Currently, it only includes dummy data for demonstration purposes.

## Future Integration

In the future, this Android app will be integrated with the backend of the WebSocket Chat Room Application, which utilizes WebSocket technology for real-time communication in chat rooms. The backend repository can be found [here](https://github.com/ZainAhmed08/websocket-springboot).
